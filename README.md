# owlflux

An opinionated UI for Miniflux
I am currently moving from RSSOwlnix to miniflux and have several features that I am looking for.
I have taken a look at `reminiflux` for inspiration.

*Note: Currently a learning project for the developer. All tips and suggestions welcome. (Including contributions)
